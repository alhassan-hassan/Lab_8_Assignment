This assignment demonstrate the manipulation of uni and multidimensional arrays in c++.

# Linearization and Inverse Functions

Linearization Function: This function was written by using nested loops. Here a counter is declared and initialized to zero. Then the nested forloop is implemented in a way that, obeys the limit of the triangular matrix by simply making the inner loop bounded by the length of the utter loop counter. The initial counter is incremented if a particular indices combination is not the same as the value stored at the specified indices in the unidimensional array. For the inverse function, the multidimensional array is looped diagonally and those inner and utter loop counters are tracked. If a particular index position gives the value specified, then those loop counters are returned.
